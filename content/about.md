Hello, 

I enjoy playing with data and here is the list of my toys:

* Linux: bash, shell scripts
* Languages: Python, sql, yaml
* distributed engines: Spark, Kafka 
* cloud services: GCS, AWS 
* data analytics tools: Pandas, Dask, Polars
* BI tools: dbt, SSIS, Mode
* sql engines: Sql Server, Postgrsql, Clickhouse, Trino
* noSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra
* data warehouse: Snowflake, BigQuery
* data visulization: Apache Superset, PowerBI , MatPlotlib
* data storage: Kafka (schema registry), Apache Parquet, Delta lake
* data orchestration: Apache Airflow, Dagster, cron
* containers: Docker, Nomad, K8
* ci/cd tools: concourse ci , github Actions, Jenkins

I'm a big fan of open source and I've contributed to couple of projects like pandas and scipy on github.

I also like to take pictures wherever I go. You can check my photos on [instagram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eshirvana/) or [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/shirvana/).
