Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Ehsan, a data enthusiast who loves diving deep into the world of bytes, pipelines, and distributed systems. Think of me as a kid in a candy storeâ€”except the candy is my ever-growing toolkit of tech toys:

    Linux: Bash, shell scripts
    Languages: Python, SQL, Rust, YAML
    Distributed Engines: Spark, Kafka
    Cloud Services: GCS, AWS
    Data Analytics Tools: Pandas, Dask, Polars
    BI Tools: dbt, SSIS, Mode
    SQL Engines: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Clickhouse, Trino
    NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra
    Data Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery
    Data Visualization: Apache Superset, Power BI, Matplotlib
    Data Storage: Kafka (Schema Registry), Apache Parquet, Delta Lake
    Data Orchestration: Databricks, Apache Airflow, Dagster, cron
    Containers: Docker, Nomad, Kubernetes
    CI/CD Tools: Concourse CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps

Iâ€™m also a huge fan of open source and proud to have contributed to projects like Pandas and SciPy on GitHub. Itâ€™s always exciting to give back to the community thatâ€™s taught me so much.

When Iâ€™m not wrangling data or optimizing workflows, I enjoy capturing the beauty of the world through my camera lens ðŸ“·. Whether itâ€™s a stunning landscape or a candid moment, photography is my creative outlet. You can check out some of my shots on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/eshirvana/) or [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/shirvana/).

Curious about my work or just want to geek out about tech, data, or photography? 
Drop me a lineâ€”letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€
